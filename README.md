The goal of these exercices is to apply the concepts learned during the [cours](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/10470827/files/282986958?module_item_id=121916816) for compression algorithms.

### Exercice 1 : RLE Algorithm ([Compression.c](compression.c))
You are asked to write a C program that resutl RLE compression algorithm of an input text (for example: input text = aaaabb, result should be #4abb).
_PS: length of input text is equal to 15._
